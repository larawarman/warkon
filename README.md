is Lara WARman and David PlaKON (we couldn't pass up the 6-letter .com)

and
# üçæ  WE'RE GETTING MARRIED IN SEPTEMBER 2017! üçæ

We couldn't be more excited.

### you (yes, you!) can help us celebrate
Just branch off of master and make a PR on this repo, and Lara will merge it. There are two rules:

1. Your edit can't change or remove any event time/place/details.
2. Your edit must be joyful, loving, in good spirit, etc.

Maybe you want to add a page with a funny memory? Maybe you want to upload an embarrassing high school picture of David? Maybe Lara could have optimized her js better? Maybe you want aliens to land in the fog on the background of the homepage? P much anything goes!
